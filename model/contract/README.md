## Contract Module

Contract Agreements are the result of a `Contract negotiation process`.
Consumers interested in acquiring a Resource are obliged to evaluate
the associated Contract offer and submit a Contract Request containing
a set of applicable rules, optionally modified to meet Consumer's needs
and capabilities. The Provider will in turn respond with an accordingly
adapted Contract Offer (when different) or Contract Agreement (when
semantically equivalent to Contract Request).

### Issues/Questions/Ideas
- References to real-world processes and agreements are *not* covered

    - may contracts affecting owners/users be signed by substitutes (providers/consumers)

- Add *consequence* (on infringed permission), *remedy* (on prohibition) duties and handling of quality/service flaws ("MÃ¤ngelrechte")
- Clarify how to express / formalize reliability ("Haftung") ?
- Add support for definition of duties on provider, e.g. to pre-process (aggregate) the provided data (e.g. based on supplied CEP-rule)
    - any related resources are attached/linked to the Contract
- Add validation rules checking for:
    - presence of parties (assignee) within the embedded rules
