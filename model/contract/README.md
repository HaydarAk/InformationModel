# Contract model

Binding agreement made between 2 or more contracting parties.
It re-uses models of usage policies, configuration models for
execution of remote Data Apps etc.

# Payment model
- Immediate payment
- Pre-paid credits
- Post-paid charge



# Issues/Questions/Ideas
- Remove subclassing of `ids:Contract` to `odrl:Policy`, - Contract "contains" policies, but does not extend those
- Real "contract" models are still missing
- References to rea-world processes and agremment closed are *not* covered
- Coverage of `ODRL` concepts (i.e. resultant Java model) is incomplete!
