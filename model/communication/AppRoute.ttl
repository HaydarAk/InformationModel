    ids:AppRoute describes the communication between data apps (such as in a data processing pipeline) inside an IDS Connector.
    An ids:AppRoute consist of multiple app endpoints which exchange data. The communication pipeline between two adjacent data apps is represented by the ids:RouteStep class.
    ids:AppRoute also holds the information about the app endpoints, which are at the start and end of the whole processing pipeline.
