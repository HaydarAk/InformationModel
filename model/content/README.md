# Content Module

`Digital Content` is a stratified model of a "standalone" content, i.e. the meaning (abstract content), the shape (representation) and an individual materialization (artifact).    
`Resource` represents a single or (set of logically related) content(s) provided at particular conditions by means of a defined interface via protocol-specific endpoints.
