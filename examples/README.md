# Reference Examples
## Scenario
The reference examples are motivated by a scenario of observing traffic 
conditions at defined locations along the European highways for purposes 
of traffic control, predictive road maintenance, toll fee optimization and so on.

## Resource
A Resource is a single digital content or a coherent set of digital contents 
exposed at particular conditions via a defined interface. Types of digital content 
range from structured data, documents, media, software etc. Examples below illustrate 
the various types and different aspects of resources.

## Example DATA1: Free, historical data download 
The resource example DATA1 showcases an easy, non-interactive access to historical data provided 
by the participant PART1. Monthly traffic statistics collected during a year since 2010 are exposed for download as individual files (“artifacts”)
via the Trusted Connector CONN2.  The file names (e.g., E37_2018_01.csv) encode by convention the discriminating parameters,
i.e. the highway (e.g., “E37”), year (e.g., “2018”), month (e.g., “01”) , and the type of file by extension (csv).
The reports comprise tabular data in CSV format. The data may be used free of charge, the policy requires a
credits citation for a commercial use.
