# Reference Examples
## Scenario
The reference examples are motivated by a scenario of observing traffic 
conditions at defined locations along the European highways for purposes 
of traffic control, predictive road maintenance, toll fee optimization and so on.

# Resource
A Resource is a single digital content or a coherent set of digital contents 
exposed at particular conditions via a defined interface. Types of digital content 
range from structured data, documents, media, software etc. Examples below illustrate 
the various types and different aspects of resources.

## Example DATA1: Free, historical data download 
The resource example DATA1 showcases an easy, non-interactive access to historical data provided 
by the participant PART1. Monthly traffic statistics collected during a year since 2010 are exposed for download as individual files (“artifacts”)
via the Trusted Connector CONN2.  The file names (e.g., E37_2018_01.csv) encode by convention the discriminating parameters,
i.e. the highway (e.g., “E37”), year (e.g., “2018”), month (e.g., “01”) , and the type of file by extension (csv).
The reports comprise tabular data in CSV format. The data may be used free of charge, the policy requires a
credits citation for a commercial use.


# Participants
## Example PART1: European traffic data provider
The hypothetical *Highway monitoring and statistics agency* acts as a data provider. It maintains a large-scale infrastructure for monitoring, 
analysis and prediction of highway utilization statistics in European context. The agency has deployed a range of mobile connectors (e.g. CONN1) 
for distributed collection and publication of geo-tagged, regional sensor data, likewise a secure connector (CONN2) for sharing valuable statistics 
reports and predictions.
  

## Example PART2: 
The OEM 


National / European coverage  i.e. single legal area


## Example PAT3: Global logistics company
International / World-wide coverage i.e. heterogeneous legal areas and regulations
Multiple (independent) subsidiaries
MAIER Logistics is a multinational logistics company with hundreds of trucks driving throughout Europe. 
The company is interested in live traffic monitoring data, as it wants to provide its drivers with up-to-the-minute 
traffic information to allow for efficient routing and timely issuing of hazard warnings. In this scenario, MAIER 
Logistics is an organization that runs several sites, such as MAIER Deutschland, Musterstraße 5, Köln, Deutschland, 
or MAIER UK, Example Road 5, Liverpool, United Kingdom. The organization complies with the ISIC classification rev. 4 
and has ISIC code 4923 (freight transport via road). For this scenario, the company’s distribution departments are 
relevant, being the organizations which control and monitor outbound distribution via trucks. The distribution 
departments are part of the MAIER Logistics Organization. Each distribution department has a specific site. 
The German Distribution department is located at MAIER Logistics Distribution Cologne, Musterallee 323, Köln, 
Deutschland. MAIER Logistics Distribution Cologne assumes the role of a Data Consumer in data Example DAT3. 
It has a valid certificate and a unique identity. As a Data Consumer, it receives notifications with hazard warnings 
and congestion information. The information received is processed by a custom software of the department, which 
sends the information to the trucks using geo-location information.
